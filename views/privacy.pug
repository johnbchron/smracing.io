      h1.vr Privacy Policy
      p We care about your privacy. We promise that no matter what you do on this website, we will be doing the most we possibly can to ensure your safety.

      p We only collect information you give us with the understanding that we will store it and only use it for the reason you give it to us. We don’t use any creepy trackers or analytics programs to gather information about you. The only information we gather without explicit user input is how many people visit each article. We don’t even keep track of who it is that visits them.

      p That being said, we may have to use scripts from other websites on occasion that do collect information. This privacy policy does not apply to them and you should see their individual privacy policies. If you worry about these websites, we recommend installing some sort of blocker for their trackers.

      p If you have any concerns about your data or privacy, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we'll try to assist you.

      p This policy is effective as of September 4 2021.
